**Have you ever had a task that you put off until it became almost impossible?**

For the past year or so, that became me and my website. 

I know that authors have to market. I know that our website is an important introduction to new readers and existing fans.

But I suffer from imposter syndrome and became paralysed by the thought of redoing my new banner, adding content and updating my new books and covers. 

A couple of weeks ago, I reached out to some author friends with ideas for new branding. They hated it. Well, to be fair, they thought I *could do better*. So, I tried again, and again. Nothing felt *right* and I started to give up hope. I mean, to rebuild my website, I needed a brand that felt like *me*.

Then, I was talking with a good friend and author, Sasha Marshall. She asked me what symbol resonated with me. I couldn't answer her, but I knew that I wanted my brand to represent me and my Australianisms. We talked and shared ideas and then the answer came from out of the blue.

My beloved nana had a frangipani tree in her garden. I grew up picking flowers and making necklaces for us and her friends. 

These small, precious flowers take me back to my childhood. They take me back to a time when I felt loved, safe and as if anything was possible. I'd found my symbol. 

So, here we are. Welcome to my rebranded website. It's been a monumental piece of work and I am secretly terrified of broken links. If you find one, please let me know. If you love the new branding and layout, I'd love to hear your feedback.

Have an amazing day and I hope you find time to curl up with a favorite book boyfriend - or two.
