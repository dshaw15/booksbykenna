## What is Choose Your Own Romance?
Choose your own romance puts the power in the reader’s hands — you decide where the story goes and how it ends.  

When Shae’s rockstar first love joins her husband’s band on tour, old sparks fly. Will she stay loyal to her marriage, rekindle her first love, or explore something new with a friend who’s always been there? You decide. Each path offers a complete love story—and you can switch directions anytime.

Each option can be read as its own romance. But you can change options during the book, or go back and make different choices. It's up to you, the reader. You pick her path to the love she deserves.

## Why readers love _Choose Your Own Romance_ books
Readers love being empowered.  
Readers love Choose Your Own Romances because they shape the story of who to love, what risks to take, and how the story ends. 
- 🚪 *sliding door moments* with multiple options for our heroine to find love  
- ❤️ *shape the romance* within the romance story structure you love  
- 🎮 *interactive and immersive* watch our heroine have reasons to love both or all men – just like in real life  
- 💍 *multiple happily-ever-after* options  
- 🔄 *choose once and then choose again* with multiple full love story options in one book  

## What makes a great _Choose Your Own Romance_?

Would you choose a
- *first love* or *instalove* 💘  
- *second chance with a first love* or *second chance with a repentant husband* 🔄  
- *second chance marriage* or *friends to lovers* 💍  

Choose your own romance has all that you love about *love triangles* but you decide which path. Most of these romances have three options - giving our heroine real life options. All heroes love her. All heroes deserve her. 

## Is _Choose Your Own Romance_ just a gimmick?

Readers tell me they feel more emotionally invested when the heroine has real choices. It’s not just a twist on the love triangle—it’s a deeper, more immersive way to experience romance.

## Is _Choose Your Own Romance_ like Choices or Episodes?

All interactive books or stories put the reader in control.  

_Choose Your Own Romance_ style books are written in first or third person and follow the romance story arc: meet cute - reasons to be apart - working through issues - torn apart - happily ever after.  

The difference is that our heroine has the same, full romance story arc with each potential hero - you pick her path to the happily ever after. In other _pick the path_ style books, once you choice one path, there is usually no opportunity to go back and choose again without restarting the story.
