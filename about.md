## Romance with a touch of reality—and a twist you control.

What Americans call “down under,” I call home: sandy beaches, semi-tropical hinterland, two dogs, one cat (who pretends she doesn’t love me), and the love of my life. I started writing when multiple sclerosis nudged me toward my bucket list—and at the top was this:  
**Write the books I want to read.**

So I do. My stories are filled with second chance romance, forbidden love, and emotional twists that feel real. You’ll find secrets—about identity, jobs, and surprise babies. You’ll meet lovers torn between loyalty and desire. And you’ll get to choose how it all ends.

I write:
- 💔 *Second chance romance* with emotional depth  
- 🔥 *Friends to lovers* and *enemies to lovers* with instant attraction  
- 💍 *Forbidden love*—bosses, best friends’ siblings, and forced proximity  
- 🎭 *Interactive romance* where you choose the heroine’s happily ever after

If you’ve ever read *Choices* or *Episodes*, you’ll love my **Choose Your Own Romance** series. Each book lets you decide who the heroine ends up with—her first love, her best friend, or the man she never saw coming. Change your mind? Link back and choose again.

Because love isn’t always predictable. And sometimes, the man you’ve always loved… isn’t the one you’re meant to be with.

Life’s too short for bad coffee or boring books. So here’s to many happy hours curled up with the best of both.  
Or tea. Or both.
