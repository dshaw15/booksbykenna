## He loves her. She loves him not. Before he can save his marriage, this war hero must come home and save his wife.

**Captain Doug Greenwood** 

How the hell could she do this to him?

Doug has only ever had two loves: his family and the Australian Army. Elisha knew that when she married him and nothing has changed. Except while Doug was overseas dodging bullets and bombs, she ended their marriage. 

He loves her. She loves him not. But if the price of her life is her hate, then he'll do anything to save her.

**Elisha**

Loving Doug was never her problem; one minute, a loving and playful father, the next her sexy war-hero husband. But she no longer recognises the man she once married. Not with his dark moods and radio silence. The reasons to leave him have multiplied and loving him is no longer a reason to stay. 

When her one attempt to meet someone fails, Elisha's family and business are threatened by a stalker who refuses to take _no_ for an answer. 

Doug would save her, if he knew. But with his darkness out of control, what will it take for him to save himself?
