## What if your heart had more than one true love—and you had to choose?

Brynne built her life around being the perfect corporate wife. But when her husband Owen’s devotion to business leaves her emotionally adrift, and her first love Ed Alexander reappears—now a decorated military officer—Brynne’s carefully curated world begins to crack.

**Owen** believes their marriage is solid.  
**Ed** wants a second chance.  
**And Brynne?** She’s torn between the man she married, the man she left, and the woman she’s becoming.

In this steamy, emotionally charged **interactive romance**, *you* decide Brynne’s fate. Will she fight for her marriage, rekindle a lost love, or choose herself?

**Choose once. Then choose again.**  
Because when one happily ever after isn’t enough, you get to write the ending.

_Perfect for fans of second chance romance, military heroes, and love triangles with heart._
