## He thought he was invincible—until the night that proved him wrong.

**Lieutenant Damon "Mack" Mackenzie** never wanted a relationship that lasted longer than a weekend. Then he saved Xanthe Davies from her ex and discovered a woman who made him question everything: his reputation, his past, and the walls he’d built around his heart.

But when a mission leaves Mack broken in ways he can’t hide, he's convinced Xanthe deserves more than the man he's become.

**Xanthe** knows better. She’s been burned before and knows the risks of loving a hero. 

Mack’s kisses promise forever, even if he’s too stubborn to believe he is deserving of love. 

Can Xanthe prove to the man she loves that he has the strength, the passion, and the fire that made her fall for in love, or will he push her away one time too many?

_Fall in love with Mack and Xanthe in this scorching military romance where a wounded hero must fight for love, honor, and the woman who makes him believe in forever._
