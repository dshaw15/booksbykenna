## Fall in love with the men and town of Meringa - where it only takes a SPARK to IGNITE romance

In the small Australian town of Meringa, the only thing hotter than the bushfires, are the sportsmen and firefighters.

Bailey Rexworth might have loved Sharalyn Curren since primary school, but he's never crossed the friend-zone. He watched her marry his best friend and helped carry the coffin at Rob's funeral.

After three years of grief, Shar Curren is struggling to survive. Each day is a battle to hold onto her husband's memory, keep their business afloat, and raise their three young daughters alone.

Shar wants to see Bailey as more than a friend, but it's not just their hearts that matter.

Will her precocious, eldest daughter ever accept a new man in Shar's life? Can friends become lovers? Or will Bailey and Shar be destined to stop at a SPARK?

SPARK is a small-town, slow-burn romance and a *short-read* introduction to the IGNITE series. These men put their bodies on the line on the sports field, and their lives on the line fighting fires. Fall in love with the town and men of Meringa today.

**Love the beachside hamlet of Meringa?**

I spent many years on the south coast of Australia and created the fictional town of Meringa based on the towns and people I loved. Since many of these towns were destroyed in the 2020 firestorm, it seemed appropriate to base the IGNITE series in Meringa and I hope you can feel my emotion on the page.

Meringa was also the perfect setting for Erebus' new start in [Broken Trust](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCXFKGH/ "Broken Trust"), and the Loving the Band rockstar reverse harem series starting with [Seducing the Band](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087YTB5J7/ "Seducing the Band").
