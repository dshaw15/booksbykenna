## One single dad. One forbidden romance. One rugby team that could change everything.

Bronx Parker lost everything — his marriage, his career, and nearly his daughter because of his-wife's lies.  
Now he’s rebuilding in secret with the opportunity to coach the new Southern Mavericks rugby league team.

He’s focused. Fierce. Unforgiving.  
Until Willow Caton walks into his life.

She’s his daughter’s teacher.  
She’s off-limits.  
And she’s the first woman who’s made him feel again.

As the Mavericks get closer to reality, and the DNA results are against him, the stakes have never been higher.  
Bronx must choose between fighting to remain in his daughter's life, reclaiming his career, and claiming the woman who’s stolen his heart.
