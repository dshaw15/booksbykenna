## I'm so excited to share the prequel to my rugby league sports romance series in the Well Played anthology.

_single father ~ daughter's teacher ~ forbidden love ~ age gap ~ secret job ~ sports romance anthology_

Bronx Parker’s life shattered when his ex-wife’s betrayal not only cost him his career but nearly his daughter. 
Determined to rebuild, he seizes the opportunity to coach a new rugby league team, the Southern Mavericks, under a veil of secrecy. 
When he meets Willow Caton, his daughter’s caring and gorgeous teacher, he dares to dream of a love and career he thought were lost forever. But as Bronx finds himself torn between maintaining access to his beloved daughter and pursuing a future with the woman who has claimed his heart, he faces an impossible choice. 

Will he risk everything for a chance at true happiness, or will he be left with nothing at all?
