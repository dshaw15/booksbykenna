## One music festival. One bed. One dirty blonde who stole the lead singer’s heart.

_Tell me what you want, Xavier was the first man to ever ask._

Before she played with and enjoyed the band.  
Before she broke the band—and had to put them back together.    
She was just a woman running from her past.

At a remote music festival, she hides in the crowd—anonymous, untouchable, and done with love. Until Xavier Gallis, lead singer of The Flying Monkeys, sees her. Wants her. Claims her.

Three days. One bed. Instant attraction.  
And a secret that could destroy everything.
