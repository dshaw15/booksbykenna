## What if the man who broke your heart was still the love of your life?

Juliette spent twenty years as the loyal corporate wife, loving mother, and best friend. But when her husband’s affair shatters their marriage, Juliette is forced to confront the woman she used to be—and the woman she wants to become.

**Roland** regrets everything and will do anything to win her back.  
**Trent** offers passion, trust, and a week of rediscovering intimacy.  
**Ric** sees the pain Juliette hides—and wants to help her heal.

Now Juliette must choose: forgiveness, freedom, or a new kind of love.

In this steamy, emotionally raw **interactive romance**, *you* decide Juliette’s fate. Will she rebuild her marriage, embrace a new lover, or finally choose herself?

**Choose once. Then choose again.**   
Because when one happily ever after isn’t enough, you get to write the ending.

_Perfect for fans of second chance romance, cheating redemption arcs, and emotional healing through love._
