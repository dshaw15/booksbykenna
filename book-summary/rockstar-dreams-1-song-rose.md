## I'm so excited to share the book 1 in my new Rockstar Dreams series in the Well Played anthology.

_heroine with disability | washed up rockstar | friends to lovers | secret identity | romance anthology_

Stuck playing the club circuit instead of touring with a band, Tony de Marco grapples with his feelings for two women. Teasing Georgia refuses to take their online friendship into the real world while the chemistry with Rose threatens to break through the friend zone.
Rose waited a year for Tony to see past her wheelchair, for the first date, and first kiss.
But after sharing her greatest secret, their fledgling love is torn apart.
He ran first, but Rose refuses to be found. 
Can a _Song for Rose_ be enough to win back the woman he loves?

Book 1 in my Rockstar Dreams series is only available in the Rock My Heart anthology.
Book 2, **[Tempest in a Song](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX8JRV7Z/ "Tempest in a Song")** is available for preorder today.

**Rock My Heart** is the latest rockstar romance anthology from the Romance Cafe Publishing. **Get [Rock My Heart](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG84XQCF/ "Rock My Heart") today.**
