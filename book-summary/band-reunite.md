## One woman. Five rockstars. And the man she loves — taken.

The band is broken.  
My heart is shattered.  
And Xavier is gone.

Kidnapped.  
No ransom.  
No clues.  
Just a trail of threats and a past I thought I’d buried.

I don’t expect to get him back alive.  
But I’m not giving up.

With my protective brother and his friend Ibby by my side, I’ll do whatever it takes to bring Xavier home—even if it means risking everything.  
Because this band is more than music.  
They’re mine.   
And even if Xavier never forgives me, and even if Jax doesn't believe my heart is big enough for them all, I won’t let us fall apart.

**Reuniting the Band** is Book Three in *Loving the Band*, a steamy **why choose rockstar romance** series where one woman doesn’t have to choose between the men who love her.  
Expect emotional suspense, found family, jealous lovers, and a rescue mission that could break them—or bind them forever.
