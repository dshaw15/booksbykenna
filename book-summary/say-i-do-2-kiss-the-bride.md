## What will it take for Hunter to Kiss the Bride?

Hunter Williams was Olivia Woodgrove's best friend before becoming her first love—and the first man to break her heart. When Olivia catches her fiancé in bed with her bridesmaid just hours before the wedding, it's the best man, Hunter, who helps her escape. Becoming a runaway bride, Olivia takes off on the honeymoon Hunter had secretly paid for—don't ask.

Away from the chaos, Olivia is forced to confront her tangled emotions. Is Hunter simply a rebound, or was her ex-fiancé the real mistake? As she grapples with her feelings and a second chance seems possible, her ex and their friends crash the honeymoon.

Olivia's ex-fiancé wants forgiveness. Her first love wants her to be happy.

Will Hunter fight for their second chance at love, or will Olivia leave the island and Hunter behind forever?

"Kiss the Bride" is a slow-burn, second-chance romance set in a romantic holiday destination perfect for a runaway bride.
