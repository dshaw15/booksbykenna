## What will it take for the best man to Kiss the Bride?

**Olivia**  
I was supposed to marry the wrong man.    
Instead, I caught him cheating with my bridesmaid hours before the ceremony.  

Now I’m a runaway bride on a tropical honeymoon with my best friend—and first love—Hunter Williams.

He’s the one who broke my heart years ago.  
He’s also the one who paid for this trip. Don’t ask.  
One bed. One island. One chance to figure out if I’m still angry… or still in love.

But when my ex crashes the honeymoon, I have to choose: forgiveness, or the future I never stopped wanting.

**Hunter**  
I was her best friend.  
Then her first kiss.  
Then the guy who messed it all up.

Now I’m the best man helping her escape a wedding she never should’ve walked into.

I wanted Olivia to be happy—even if it wasn’t with me.

But sharing a bed in paradise is testing every boundary I swore I’d keep.

She’s falling for me again. And I’m starting to believe we were never really over.

If I want her back, I’ll have to fight for the second chance I never thought I’d get.

_Kiss the Bride is a steamy second-chance romantic comedy with friends-to-lovers tension, forced proximity, and a runaway bride who finally chooses herself_
