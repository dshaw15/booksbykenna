## One spark is all it takes for love to ignite.

Campbell Mettner returns to his seaside hometown of Meringa for a weekend of cold beer and no commitments. But when he walks into a local café and meets Natalia, the fiery owner with no time for love, everything changes.

Natalia poured her life savings into her dream café. Romance wasn’t part of the plan—until Cam, the town’s football legend and firefighting hero, turns her world upside down.

Then the firestorm hits. Cam is thousands of miles away. Natalia is forced to flee. And love might be the only thing worth risking everything for.
