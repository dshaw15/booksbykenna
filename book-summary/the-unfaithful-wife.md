## She was the perfect wife—until she wasn’t.

**Nina Elphaine** had the life most women envy: a glittering career, beautiful children, and a husband who promised forever. But forever shattered the night she found him with her protégé. Now, the woman who always played by the rules is rewriting them.

Three men. One heart. No easy answers.  
**Derek**, her husband, swears it was a mistake. He wants forgiveness. He wants her back. But he’s about to learn Nina has secrets of her own.  
**Roland**, her best friend—and her lover—has always been the one who sees her clearly. Their affair was never meant to last. But what if it could?  
**Lucas**, the younger stranger who calls her “Tina,” only had one night. He wants more. And Nina can’t stop thinking _what if_.

She’s been the faithful wife. The betrayed woman. The secret lover. Now, she gets to choose who she’ll become.

**Choose once. Then choose again.**  
In this steamy, emotionally charged interactive romance, you decide Nina’s fate. Will she return to the man who broke her? Risk everything for forbidden love? Or finally choose herself?

_The Unfaithful Wife is a provocative journey through betrayal, desire, and second chances._  
_Perfect for fans of The Perfect Wife, The Politician’s Wife, and emotionally rich stories where love isn’t simple—and happily ever after is never guaranteed._
