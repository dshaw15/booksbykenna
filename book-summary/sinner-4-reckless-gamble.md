## When the lights go down, deals are done and only the winner survives

**GG**  
If anyone recognizes me, I’m dead.  
If I lose my borrowed stake on the first night, I’m dead.  
This is my last shot at freedom—and I won’t waste it on trust or love.  
One final reckless gamble. This time, it’s not my heart on the line. It’s my life.

**Scott**  
She walked into my poker game and stole my stack—and my attention.  
GG is trouble wrapped in secrets, and I should walk away.  
But she’s trusting me with her life.  
And for her sake, I can’t afford to lose.  

_In a world of dirty money and dangerous men, GG plays to survive._  
_Scott plays to win._
Together, they’ll risk everything in a high-stakes game of deception, desire, and redemption.
Reckless Gamble is a standalone billionaire romance with secret identities, mafia danger, enemies-to-lovers heat, and a guaranteed HEA.
