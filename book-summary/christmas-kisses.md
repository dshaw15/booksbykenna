**These four women will beg, borrow or buy a man ... but will they find love this Christmas?**


_Her Christmas Romance Surprise (Book 1: Pia)_

*Pia*  I didn’t expect to find my fake Christmas date online. But when the mysterious K made me laugh and said all the right things, he gave me the same country boy feels of my first crush.

*Kade*  First son will always inherit his father’s kingdom and the woman’s heart. As for me, I left home, the kingdom and tried to forget the woman. Pia was the only woman I ever wanted. The only woman my brother could never have. Now, I'm about to meet my online date and Pia Morgan just walked through the door. The right woman, wrong time.

_Her Surprise Christmas Noel (Book 2: JoJo)_

JoJo needed a date for Christmas. Noel needed to make up for his mistake. It was only supposed to be a fake date, but what if it became real?

*Noel*  JoJo is the most infuriating woman I’ve ever met.
By days we fight—a lot. 
By nights we make up—a lot.
We might have to sell our fake romance as real. But I don’t think my heart got the message.

_Unwrapping Her Christmas Gift (Book 3: Abbie)_

Abbie thought it was too late to find a date for Christmas. Tristan didn’t expect to find a woman who could see past his act. But can one night together be enough to stop Abbie’s fear of repeating the past? Or can a man who makes his living unwrapping clothes from his body be the man to unwrap her heart?

_Her Surprise Christmas Kiss (Book 4: Zara)_

*Vince*  I know, it’s going to take a Christmas miracle to prove to Zara I deserve a second chance. Luckily, Christmas Eve is the time for miracles, and I’ve got all night to make up for lost time. One Christmas church service for each of the five we’ve missed. But if Zara is taking home someone for Christmas, has it all been too little and too late?

*Zara*  It’s not that I hate Christmas. 
My last merry Christmas was the last day before she-who-shall-be-forever-nameless gave my fiancé the ultimatum.
He chose her. I don’t hate Christmas. I hate the memories of that one Christmas.
Five years on and I still love him. But it will take more than making me laugh to win back my trust.

_Four women. One pact. Find a fake date for Christmas._
