## He swore to defend her. He never expected she’d steal his heart.

**Lieutenant Colonel Edison “Ed” Alexander** is a decorated war hero—not a babysitter. 

But when his former commanding officer asks, there are decades of reasons to comply. She's just one woman. How hard can it be to keep her safe - to keep her alive? 

The simple assignments are never easy. Protecting Anastacia should be a simple favor. 

Until he discovers her secret.  
There's a reason she's hiding from her ex.  
There's a reason she never wanted her father to know.  
_And now Ed knows, he vows no one will ever hurt her again._

But Anastacia's never been a woman to follow orders, and this time the price will be paid in blood.

**Anastacia Vaughan** spent her life avoiding soldiers, determined not to fall for a man who serves the Army before anything else. But when her abusive ex husband tracks her down, the only man who can keep her safe is the one she swore she wouldn’t want.

Forced into hiding together, desire sparks into a dangerous inferno. Instant attraction becomes love.

She wants to forget her past, but her ex husband is more ruthless than she imagined. 

Ed promised to protect her. Ed promised to serve her father. The mistake was falling in love. Anastacia can't save herself, but can she save the two men she loves?

_Defend Her is a high-stakes military romance packed with forced proximity, enemies-to-lovers tension, and a fiercely protective hero._
