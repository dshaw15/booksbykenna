## One jaded rockstar rebuilding a broken band. One symphony queen hiding a life-or-death secret. And a found family that refuses to accept her on their stage.

After his band’s implosion, **rockstar Zeb Bach** doesn’t need another PR disaster. What he needs is a clean slate, a sold-out tour, and zero distractions—not a brilliant but infuriating symphony musician who thinks she can run his life.

**Tempest** may look like perfection, but she’s hiding a life-or-death secret that controls everything she does. She’s not about to let a reckless, tattooed rocker blow her cover—or her carefully guarded heart.

But when their music collides, so does their chemistry. And when Tempest disappears, Zeb has to decide—fight for his career or fight for the only woman who ever made him believe again.

_Tempest in a Song is a steamy enemies-to-lovers, forced proximity rockstar romance with emotional depth, sizzling passion, and a love that hits all the right notes._
