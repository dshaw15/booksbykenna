**Love the beachside hamlet of Meringa?**

I spent many years on the south coast of Australia and created the fictional town of Meringa based on the towns and people I loved. Since many of these towns were destroyed in the 2020 firestorm, it seemed appropriate to base the IGNITE series in Meringa and I hope you can feel my emotion on the page.

Meringa was also the perfect setting for Erebus' new start in [Broken Trust](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCXFKGH/ "Broken Trust"), and the Loving the Band rockstar reverse harem series starting with [Seducing the Band](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087YTB5J7/ "Seducing the Band").
