## A broken hero, forced proximity, forbidden love, rugby league sports romance

_A lie by omission is still a lie_

**Kenzie**
And just like that, I lost my home, my job, and my dog. Oh, and I also lost my boyfriend, but he lied and cheated, so no big loss I guess.
To reclaim my dog, I need a job. The only one on offer is publicist for the Southern Mavericks football team.

I didn’t expect to fall for the captain, then he made me laugh.
I didn’t want to share a hotel room with him, let alone a bed.
I can’t date a player when I’m working for the team.
Workplace romances never work out, I should know.

**Cooper**
Search my name, and rugby is hardly mentioned.
I played hard, avoided relationships, earned my bad-boy reputation, but my new team needs a leader. Easy.
Then I’m forced to share my room with Kenzie.

I didn’t lie, not really, but Kenzie walked away.
I will do anything to make her forgive me, even therapy.
I will be the player my team need, then man Kenzie deserves.’

**Kenzie**
Behind the banter and laughter, there’s a broken hero who I love but can’t fix him.
I can’t save him. But how can I stand back and watch the man I love self-destruct?
