## One bed. One broken hero. One woman who swore she'd never fall for a player.

**Kenzie’s life imploded in a single week.**  
She lost her home, her job, her cheating ex—and her dog.  
To get her dog back, she needs a job.  
The only offer? Publicist for the Southern Mavericks rugby league team.

She didn’t expect to fall for the captain.  
She didn’t plan to share a hotel room with him, let alone a bed.  
She can’t date a player. Not while she works for the team.

Workplace romances never end well. She should know.  

Cooper’s reputation is all bad-boy, no substance.  
Search his name, and rugby barely makes the list.  
But the Mavericks need a leader—and he’s ready to step up.  
A hotel mixup on the other side of the world means he’s forced to share a room with Kenzie.  
She's everything he didn't know he wanted and there's no stopping at one kiss.

**He didn’t lie.**  
Not really. But despite his promises, she walked away.

Now he’ll do anything to earn her trust, even therapy.  
He wants to be the captain his team needs and the man Kenzie deserves.  

But behind the banter and late-night confessions, Kenzie sees the truth:  
Cooper’s broken.  
She can’t fix him.  
And she can’t stand by while the man she loves self-destructs.

_Playing the Advantage is a steamy rugby league sports romance featuring insta attraction, forced proximity, secret dating, and a workplace romance that breaks all the rules._
