## Four women. One pact. Find a date for Christmas.

**These women will beg, borrow or buy a man ... but will they find love this Christmas?**

Abbie thought it was too late to find a date for Christmas. Tristan didn’t expect to find a woman who could see past his act. But can one night together be enough to stop Abbie’s fear of repeating the past? Or can a man who makes his living unwrapping clothes from his body be the man to unwrap her heart?

**Abbie**

How on earth am I going to explain the sexy man in my bed? Especially since my family are expecting me to introduce a boyfriend at Christmas lunch.
I don’t have a boyfriend.
But last night, after Tristan shed his clothes on stage, I was ready to take a one-night risk. 
He was supposed to remain my secret. Except Christmas plans have changed and lunch has been moved to my place. Even worse, now discovered, Tristan has decided to have fun playing the role of my fake boyfriend.
Only the longer we are fake, the more real it feels. At least, to me.

**Tristan**

I’d never believed in insta-love. 
One night of magic and all my Christmas’ came true.
There is one thing surer than the sun will rise tomorrow. 
Unless her sister ruins everything, I’ll be unwrapping Abbie for more than Christmas.
