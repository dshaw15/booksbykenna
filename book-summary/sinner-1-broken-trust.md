## Can a dangerous bad boy find redemption and a second chance at love in a small town?

**Erebus**  
Four years ago, I had it all—money, women, power, and the ego to match.
One reckless mistake destroyed everything.

To protect my parents, I changed my name and sold the only thing I had left—my body. It paid the debt, but it cost me my soul.

Now I’m in a new town, building a quiet life, and I’ve met Felicity—the kind of woman a man could love forever.

But my past isn’t gone. Every lie I’ve told her is one step closer to the truth… and when it comes out, I’ll lose the woman I never deserved.

**Felicity**  
I’ve always been the good girl—until the mysterious Mr. E walked into my world.
Strong. Magnetic. Dangerous. He could command a room with his presence, and my heart with one look.

But he’s hiding something. And when I find out what it is, I might lose him forever.
Because a man like Erebus could have any woman. Why would he want me?

_If you love alpha male romance, second chance love stories, and bad boy redemption arcs, you’ll fall for Felicity and Erebus in Broken Trust—a steamy small-town romance filled with passion, secrets, and a fight for love that could cost everything._

Cheating Warning: This romance begins with Erebus leaving the final night of his “work.” His debts are paid, but his past isn’t done with him yet.
