## Can Erebus hide his past without destroying his future?

**Erebus**
Four years ago, I had it all.
Women, money, power and ego. Before one wrong move lost it all.
Forced to change my name, I used my body to pay my debts. Yes, you can judge my morals but my parents didn't deserve to lose their life savings because they trusted their son, and my body was the only asset I had to use.
Now, I've found a new town and one woman to love. But one lie is leading to another and eventually, all roads will lead to the truth.
If Felicity finds out, I'll lose the woman I never deserved.

**Felicity**
I was always the good girl. Until the mysterious Mr. E. walked into my life.
His body can command a room as quickly as his eyes can command my heart.
Only he's hiding a secret and I'm terrified of learning his truth.
After all, Erebus could have any woman. Why would he want just me?


Felicity never wanted to love a bad boy. But Erebus stole her heart from their first kiss. If you love your alpha males, you'll want to know the real Erebus and get **Broken Trust** today.

Cheating warning - Broken Trust starts with Erebus leaving after a night "working" and realizing that with his debts paid, it is time to close down this chapter of his life. 

Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone. 

**Why I loved Erebus and Felicity - author's note**
Why do 'good girls' love 'bad boys'? 
That's a question that I keep asking myself. What is it about them that makes us want to 'fix' them, especially when they don't want to be fixed.
Erebus doesn't want to be fixed. He owns the mistakes he made, and has put his ego and reputation aside to save his parent's home. He's finally ready to move on with his life but what if he can't?
Have you made a mistake that people can never forgive? Alternatively, are there hard limits to what you will and won't forgive?
That's what I wanted to explore with Erebus and Felicity. Not only did I want to see his personal growth, I wanted to challenge Felicity on who she thought she was.
I've come back and rewritten Broken Trust twice. I've recovered the book more than that. Now, he is as perfect on the page as he has always been in my heart. 
And if you love Felicity and Erebus as much as I do, then check out the IGNITE series. That's right. Not only is Erebus going to search for his missing billion throughout **City Sinners**, but his new home in Meringa is about to be hit by a devastating bushfire. Get to know the small town firefighting heroes in **IGNITE**
