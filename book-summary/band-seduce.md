**Sydney**
I couldn’t believe my luck.
Caught on a tour bus with The Flying Monkeys when lockdown happened.
It was only supposed to be one night with lead singer, Xavier Galis. But now there was nowhere else I wanted to be. 
Xavier might be my one, but by the end of lockdown, I doubt he’ll be my only.
