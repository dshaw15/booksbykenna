## One tour bus. One lockdown. One woman running from her past—and straight into the arms of the band.

**Sydney**  
I never meant to fall for Xavier Gallis, lead singer of The Flying Monkeys.  
It was supposed to be one anonymous night. A reckless escape from the secrets chasing me.

Then disaster hit.  
Now I’m stuck on a tour bus with the entire band—and they’re not just gorgeous, they’re watching me. Wanting me. Loving me.

Xavier was my first. But he won’t be my only.  
Because the longer I stay, the harder it is to resist the others.  
And the more I fall, the closer my past gets to catching up.
