## Rockstar Romance >> Choose Your Own Romance >> Love Triangle

_The lead singer from aging rockers, Stormy Waters or the lead from the world’s hottest new band, God of War? Two loves, one future. Who will Shae choose?_

**Shae Fedolta**

My rockstar husband doesn’t know the lead singer of his new support band used to be the lead musician to my heart.  
Can our marriage survive one tour or will Deacon remind me of why I should never have left?

Years ago, Deacon was my first love but when he chose pills and the bottle, I chose to leave.  
Now he’s the man I fell in love with and desperate to give us the future we once deserved.

_But, I love my husband._
Cruz no longer sees me as the band’s manager.  
He wants me to be the stay at home wife, the mother of his future children, his muse.

_I love them both. But when all truths are exposed, will I have the chance to choose?_
