## One injury. One secret romance. One woman he was never supposed to love.

Maverick’s rugby league career is over—and the media wants blood.  
After a devastating injury, he’s hiding out in his best friend’s home, dodging headlines and searching for a future that doesn’t feel like failure.

He didn’t plan to fall for Sara.  
She’s his best friend’s little sister.  
She’s off-limits.  
And she’s everything he never thought he deserved.

Sara’s spent years being overlooked—just the wallflower, just Kenzie’s kid sister.  
But now she’s back from college, and there’s one man she never forgot.

They shouldn’t.  
Kenzie will never forgive them.  
But one kiss with Maverick changes everything.

Now they’re sneaking around, stealing moments, and risking it all.  
If their secret gets out, Maverick could lose his second chance at rugby—and the only woman who ever made him believe in love.
