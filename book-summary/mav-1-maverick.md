## Will a second chance at the career I love cost me the woman I've always loved?

**Maverick**

I never expected to fall in love with Sara, my best friend’s little sister. But when a career-ending injury sidelines my rugby dreams, I need a place to hide from the media, and Sara becomes more than just a safe haven.

As friends turned lovers, we juggle hidden kisses and stolen moments, all while keeping our secret from her sister. If anyone discovers our romance, I'll risk losing my new career before it starts and my best friend’s trust. I know Sara's worth it, but can I be the man she deserves, or will she eventually see me as a washed-up footballer?

**Sara**

For years, I've been 'the little sister,' 'the plain wallflower,' and 'just Kenzie's sibling.'
One kiss changed everything. Years of dreaming about my sister's best friend turned into hopes for a happily ever after. But when Maverick finds a new, secret job that consumes all his waking hours, I start to wonder if I was just a distraction from his injury. Maverick is worth facing my sister’s wrath, but can a girl like me ever be worth his love?

Playing the Maverick is a heartwarming secret romance that faces the challenge of falling for your best friend’s sister, set against the backdrop of a rugby league sports romance.
