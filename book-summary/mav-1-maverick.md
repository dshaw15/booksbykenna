## One injury. One secret romance. One woman he was never supposed to love.

Maverickâ€™s rugby league career is overâ€”and the media wants blood.  
After a devastating injury, heâ€™s hiding out in his best friendâ€™s home, dodging headlines and searching for a future that doesnâ€™t feel like failure.

He didnâ€™t plan to fall for Sara.  
Sheâ€™s his best friendâ€™s little sister.  
Sheâ€™s off-limits.  
And sheâ€™s everything he never thought he deserved.

Saraâ€™s spent years being overlooked:  
ðŸ’‹ just the wallflower  
ðŸ’‹ just Kenzieâ€™s kid sister.  
But now sheâ€™s back from college, and thereâ€™s one man she never forgot.

They shouldnâ€™t.  
Kenzie will never forgive them.  
But one kiss with Maverick changes everything.

Now theyâ€™re sneaking around, stealing moments, and risking it all.  
If their secret gets out, Maverick could lose his second chance at rugbyâ€”and the only woman who ever made him believe in love.
