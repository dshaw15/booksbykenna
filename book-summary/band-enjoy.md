## One woman. Five rockstars. And a past that wants her crawling back.

I thought I could outrun my past.  
I thought I could hide behind the music, the tour bus, the small town pub, and the love of five irresistible men.  
But now the concert is days away, and the messages won’t stop.

_Anon: Come back and I’ll forgive you._  
_Anon: Crawling. Begging. On your knees._

My ex knows I’m alive.  
He knows I’m with the band.  
And he’s not the forgiving type.

Xavier is spiraling.  
The band is fracturing.  
And I’m terrified that if I press send — if I unleash the power I’ve built behind the scenes — I’ll be found.

I chose love. I chose desire. I chose this band.  
But if I want to keep my dirty secret and my dirty blonde heart, I’ll have to risk everything.

**Enjoying the Band** is Book Two in *Loving the Band*, a steamy **why choose rockstar romance** series where one woman doesn’t have to choose between the men who love her.  
Expect jealous lovers, emotional suspense, found family, and one woman who refuses to be silenced.

_Anon: If I can find your number, I can find you._  
_Anon: CU soon._
