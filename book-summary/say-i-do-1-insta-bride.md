## I can't fall in love with my husband


**Elena**  
They say 'opposites attract' but is my marriage fake, or could his feelings be real?

To prove I’m over my ex, I joined a reality dating show. I never expected to be matched with Kye—the cocky, camera-loving charmer who’s everything I swore off.

We said “I do” for the prize money and six months of fake marriage. But the man in my bed is saying all the right things, and my heart wants to believe them.

If I fall for my husband, will he still be there when the cameras stop?

**Kye**  
I signed up for fame, followers, and fortune.
I didn’t expect to be paired with Australia’s sweetheart—or to like her more than the spotlight.

Elena’s falling for me but I don’t do relationships. 

If I break her heart, the whole world will watch me do it.

I came for the fame. Now I’m risking it all for the woman I never meant to love.

_Insta Bride is a steamy fake marriage romantic comedy with enemies to lovers heat, forced proximity, and a guaranteed HEA. Perfect for fans of Married at First Sight, The Bachelor, and Love Island._
