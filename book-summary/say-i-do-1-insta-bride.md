## I can't fall in love with my husband

_opposites attract ~ forced proximity ~ romantic comedy ~ banterific ~ fake marriage ~ money or love ~ kindleunlimited_

**Elena**

They say 'opposites attract' but is my marriage fake, or could his feelings be real?
What was I thinking? To convince my friends I was over my ex, I signed up for a reality dating show.
I never thought they'd pick me. I never thought they'd match me with the sexiest man on the island, with bedroom eyes and cock-sure attitude. One look at Kye and I knew his type. Lying. Cheating. Insert derogatory term here.
Kye would never look at me in the real world. But trapped together by his ambition and my pride, he said all the words I wanted to hear, and I’ve just said, “I do.”
If we stay married for six months, we win the cash and Kye will get more Instagram followers than he can count.
The man in my bed is rapidly stealing my heart. But can I stop from falling in love with my husband before he leaves?

**Kye**

When I walk into a room, every woman notices. When I set my eyes on a potential client, the commission might as well be mine. I thought reality TV would lead to global fame and instant fortune, except the producers paired me up with Australia’s Newest Sweetheart.
Elena's sweet to my street-smart. She's the girl next door and I'm the fox in the hen house.
The cameras are rolling, she's falling for me and I don't want to stop her.
But I don't 'do' relationships and if I break her heart, they’ll crucify me in the edit.
I was willing to do anything for fame and money. But will I throw it all away for the woman I never meant to love?

If you love forced proximity with a side of humor, or when opposites attract ...
If you have always wanted to see behind the cameras of Married At First Sight, The Bachelor or Love Island ...
