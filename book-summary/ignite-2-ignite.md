## He was a footballer, not a hero. She never wanted to be saved.

Ethan is in Meringa for one reason: football. Not firefighting. Not romance. And definitely not crashing his truck into a fiery local with zero patience and a killer smile.

Rylee has no time for arrogant athletes. She’s done with heartbreak, done with men who leave, and done with anyone who thinks they can rescue her. Especially Ethan — who’s sexy, stubborn, and absolutely not her type.

But when the bushfires close in, everything changes. She leaves. He finds her. And the heat between them becomes impossible to ignore.

She fell first. He fell harder. But can two people with nothing in common risk everything for love?
