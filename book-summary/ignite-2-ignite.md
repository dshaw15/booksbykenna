## He was a footballer, not a hero. She never wanted to be saved. But when fires burn, will love IGNITE??

**Ethan**
She. Hit. Me.
My first day in town and my truck is wrecked and I'm already regretting all of my life's choices that lead me to here. I'm here to play football, not play firefighter. If that's not good enough for this small town, then I'll find another as soon as my truck is fixed.
Rylee's sexy, sassy, and full of surprises. But I'm not looking for the perfect woman - even if she crashes into me.

**Rylee**
He's not my type.
I'm done with footballers. I'm done with sexy AF men who can have any woman they want. I'm done. Except, Ethan is more than a footballer. He's more than his billion-watt smile. But if he's not ready to be part of our small town, then we have nothing to IGNITE.

**Love the beachside hamlet of Meringa?**

I spent many years on the south coast of Australia and created the fictional town of Meringa based on the towns and people I loved. Since many of these towns were destroyed in the 2020 firestorm, it seemed appropriate to base the IGNITE series in Meringa and I hope you can feel my emotion on the page.

Meringa was also the perfect setting for Erebus' new start in [Broken Trust](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCXFKGH/ "Broken Trust"), and the Loving the Band rockstar reverse harem series starting with [Seducing the Band](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087YTB5J7/ "Seducing the Band").
