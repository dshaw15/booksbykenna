## One night of freedom. One forbidden mistake. One impossible choice.

**Emma** gave up everything—her cheer scholarship, her dream career, her social life—to raise her little sister after tragedy shattered their world. Now, joining the Southern Mavericks as a professional cheerleader is her shot at rebuilding their future.

**There’s just one rule: no involvement with the players.**  
Too bad she already broke it.

**Dylan Fleski**, the Southern Mavericks’ fullback and notorious heartbreaker, doesn’t do repeats — until one unforgettable night with a mystery woman leaves him wanting more. He never expected to see her again… let alone discover she’s the new cheerleader he’s forbidden to touch.

Their chemistry is electric.  
Their connection is undeniable.  
But with contracts, careers, and a broken family on the line, falling for each other could cost them everything.

He wants a second chance.  
She’s just trying to survive the first.

_Playing Rucking Hard is a steamy, emotional sports romance featuring forbidden love, found family, and a fierce heroine who refuses to quit. Part of Romance Café Publishing’s **Rucked By You** series, this standalone novella is set in the Southern Mavericks rugby league world._
