## One secret baby. One second chance. One woman he swore he’d never forgive.

**Randii** walked away from Dawson Briggs, taking a secret with her.

The press branded her a groupie but headlines never tell all the truth.  
She loved Dawson. Still does. Always will.  
But he deserves a career, not complications.  
And she deserves a man who will protect her as fiercely as he loves.

When her secret's out, will they have a second chance, or will Dawson take away the only person she loves more than him?

**Dawson’s** back in the game, chasing a second chance at rugby league glory.

He never stopped loving Randii.  
But love isn’t enough — not when trust is shattered.  
She says the child is his.  
He wants to believe her.  

_But forgiveness? That’s harder than any tackle on the field._

He wants his child.  
He’s not sure he wants the mother.  
Until the truth blindsides him and he realizes he'll do anything for love.

_Playing the Blindside is a steamy rugby league sports romance featuring second chances, a secret baby, and a love story undone by miscommunication and media scandal._
